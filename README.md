datahack / visualizer
=====================
 
It was a quick protype developed during the Big Data Hackathon organized by HackHackers Delhi Chapter.

The outcome was a heatmap of India, depicting the infant mortality rates in different states of India (probably in 2005; data obtained from http://data.gov.in/ ).

It was a product of [a quick one-day hackthon (journalists + coders)](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.476488175739797&type=1), that [took place around Feb'13](http://satyaakam.net/?p=746). 

This repo is a revised version of the same, compatible with Django 1.6.*
