datahack / visualizer
=====================
Found this in my stash recently. 
--------------------------------

It was a product of a day-long hackthon (journalists + coders), that took place around Feb'13. This repo is a revised version of the same, compatible with Django 1.6. [ Refer: https://bitbucket.org/arcolife/visualizer ]

It shows the mortality rates in India, in a certain year (probably it was 2005) ( data obtained from http://data.gov.in/ ) spread across the states, through a heatmap.

***

**Usage**

(requires Django 1.6)

> python manage.py runserver

Go to localhost:8000/visualizer and browse India's position on the map, 
zoom right in to see the distribution.

**Issues**

This is just a quick demo. Refactoring is not exactly a procrastinator's cup of tea. But well, jokes apart, will do it when I have some time. Not the most important task on the list right now.
