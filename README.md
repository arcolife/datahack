datahack / visualizer
=====================
 
It shows the infant mortality rates in India, in a certain year (probably it was 2005) ( data obtained from http://data.gov.in/ ) spread across the states, through a heatmap.

> This was a quick prototype, developed within really constrained time limits. 
> I don't remember the exact source of the data. 

It was a product of a day-long hackthon (journalists + coders), that took place around Feb'13. This repo is a revised version of the same, compatible with Django 1.6.*
