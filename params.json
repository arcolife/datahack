Hackathon prototype #HacksHackers New Delhi chapter","body":"datahack / visualizer\r\n=====================\r\n \r\nIt shows the infant mortality rates in India, in a certain year (probably it was 2005) ( data obtained from http://data.gov.in/ ) spread across the states, through a heatmap.\r\n\r\n> This was a quick prototype, developed within really constrained time limits. \r\n> I don't remember the exact source of the data. \r\n\r\nIt was a product of a day-long hackthon (journalists + coders), that took place around Feb'13. This repo is a revised version of the same, compatible with Django 1.6.* \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![Infant Mortality Rate Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcolife/datahack/master/static/img/datahack.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n\r\n(requires Django 1.6)\r\n\r\n> python manage.py runserver\r\n\r\nGo to http://localhost:8000 to browse India's position on the map, \r\nzoom right in to see the distribution.\r\n\r\n**Major credits:**\r\n\r\nOn Bithucket/Github:\r\n\r\n* @aparashar\r\n* @kanteshraj\r\n* @ramniquesingh\r\n* @satyaakam\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
